** Diagnostic mode
[2011-08-09 Tue]

The =-d= flag enables some diagnostic output, which primarily reports internal
activity of commands such as =expect= and =interact=. This flag has the same effect
as =exp_internal 1= at the beginning of an Expect script, plus the version of
=Expect= is printed. (The =strace= command is useful for tracing statements, and the
=trace= command is useful for tracing variable assignments.)  (When using Expectk,
this option is specified as =-diag=.)

* Automating SSH with Capistrano (+ excellent design of slides!)
[2009-12-14 Mon]

From the page [[http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/3087][Commanding Your SSH Universe with Capistrano: OSCON 2008 - O'Reilly Conferences, July 21 - 25, 2008, Portland, Oregon]]

A setup for one application might included a development server, a staging
server, a cluster of production servers and one or two servers for version
control and continuous integration. The fuse is burning at both ends for you and
there is never time to waste. Meet Capistrano. Capistrano enables you to
automate your many system administration tasks harnessing the ubiquity of SSH
and the simplicity of a Ruby DSL configuration.
